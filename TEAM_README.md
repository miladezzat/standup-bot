## ✏️ Writing Good Standups

### ✅ DO:
- **Be specific:** "Completed login API (TASK-123)" ✓
- **Use bullet points** for multiple items
- **Include task IDs** when relevant: `(TASK-123)` or `#456`
- **Mention real blockers** that need help
- **Keep items short:** 1-2 lines each
- **Use action verbs:** Completed, Fixed, Implemented, Reviewed

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Be vague:** "Worked on stuff", "Did some coding" ✗
- **Write essays** - keep it concise
- **Skip blocker details** - we want to help!
- **List non-work items** unless affecting availability
- **Overcommit** - be realistic about today's plan
